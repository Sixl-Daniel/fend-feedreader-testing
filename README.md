### Use your existing web hoster
 Just upload all files to a new directory at your website host with a FTP application. Point a domain to the games directory and you are good to go.

    ```
    $ npm install http-server -g
    ```

Change to a folder you want the game in. Then clone the files of this repo to a new directory and changee into it:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Sixl-Daniel/fend-feedreader-testing.git MyNewFeedreaderDirectory
    $ cd MyNewFeedreaderDirectory
    ```
3. **Start your web server**
    ```
    $ http-server
    ```
